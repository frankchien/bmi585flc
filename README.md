This is a R package compiling various functions that was written over the course of the semister as taught by Dr. McKay

These are the functions contained

sensitivity(pred,truth) - done
specificity(pred,truth) - done
accuracy(pred,truth) - done
ppv(pred,truth) - done
f1(pred,truth) - done

Homework 4, Problem 5. (boxMuller(n)) - done
Homework 6, Problem 1 (twoSidedT(t,n)) - done
Homework 6, Problem 1 (twoSidedZ(z)) - done
Homework 6, Problem 6 (effectSize(x,g)) - done
Homework 6, Problem 15 (welchT(x,y)) - done
Homework 7, Problem 1 (minimumN(d)) - done
Homework 7, Problem 10 (chiSquareCounts(tib)) - done (sort of)
Homework 7, Problem 11 (postHocPower(d,n1,n2)) - done
Homework 8, Problem 1 (bhAdjust(p)) - done (returns logical vector, varify were not looking for adjusted p values)
Homework 8, Problem 1 (fdrAdjust(p)) - done (returns logical vector)
Homework 11, Problem 1 (r2(pred,truth)) - done
Homework 11, Problem 1 (adjR2(pred,truth)) - done (also takes in d = number of prediction variables)

unscale(x) - done
pcApprox(x, npc): - done (no clue if done right, but done)
pcLollipop(x): - not done
